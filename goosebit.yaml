## Settings to adjust for each installation

# Port to host the server on, default:
#port: 60053 # GOOSE ;)

# Database to be used, default:
#db_uri: sqlite:///<project root>/db.sqlite3
#db_ssl_crt: /<project root>/ca-certificate.crt

# Path to the directory containing artifact files, default:
#artifacts_dir: /<project root>/artifacts

# Frequency that devices should check for available updates.
poll_time: 00:01:00

# Whether to track the IP of the device when it polls.  Useful for debugging, but can be turned off for privacy.
#track_device_ip: true

# Device authentication settings
# Token-based device authentication
#device_auth:
#  enable: false

# The auth mode, one of:
# - strict: Strict mode, all devices must have keys, and all keys must be set via the API.
# - lax: Lax mode, devices which have keys must use them, but devices without keys do not require them.
# - setup: Setup mode, any devices polling with an auth token that don't have one will save it.
# Setup mode is designed for users migrating from other services, it makes setting up existing devices easy.
#  mode: strict

# Secret key used for parsing user sessions. It is HIGHLY advised to pass this as an environment variable instead.
# Defaults to a randomized value. If this value is not set, user sessions will not persist when app restarts.
#secret_key: my_very_top_secret_key123

# User account for the frontend. Available permissions:
# "software.read", "software.write", "software.delete"
